## Bare Metal Recovery for Managed Cloud



* Windows BMR

Windows BMR capabilities and limitations:

This solution provides several Avamar features to simplify BMR of Windows Server 
2008, Windows Server 2012, Windows 7, or Windows 8 client machines

The WinPE ISO is available with 64-bit and 32-bit version.

Avamar provides BMR from physical machine to physical machine, as well as virtual 
machine to virtual machine.

N.B.: 

1) Avamar Windows Disaster Recovery is not supported for volumes encrypted with 
BitLocker Drive Encryption.

2) Recovery will fail to initialize and format the disk when the restore system’s 
disk size is different than the initial backup system disk size, even though the restore 
system’s disk size is sufficient for the disaster recovery backup data. 
All target disks on the restore system need to be as large as the original disks. After disaster recovery, 
there may be some unallocated space. This extra space can be used by extending the 
partition after the DR.

We highly recommend to choose exactly the same disk size as the initial one.
